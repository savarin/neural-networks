    "The first layer we'll introduce is called the convolutional layer. Instead of having a weight matrix of shape (output length x input length), we'll instead consider a 3x3 weight matrix called a filter or kernel. We take the vector product of the filter with each (overlapping) 3x3 grid in the 28x28 image.\n",

For an 24x24x32 input, this results in 12x12x32 output. This volume is then 'flattened' to a vector of length 4,608, which we manipulate the same way as any vector.\n",

This allows our model to scale better and be more translation-invariant. The pooling layer also reduces the number of parameters, helping reduce computation and limit overfitting.\n",

    "To preserve the sequential nature of the sentence, we would train our Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) by feeding each word index one by one. However, it gets expensive to keep track of long-term dependencies, for example between \"series\" and \"story\" in the first sentence. Gradient contributions in deep networks have a tendency of vanishing to zero - this effect is referred to as the 'vanishing gradient' problem.\n",
